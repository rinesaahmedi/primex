🎨 Brand Visual Guidelines

This project uses a unified visual identity designed for modern B2B digital experiences.
All visual elements — UI components, social graphics, diagrams, and marketing visuals — must follow the color and typography standards below.

🌤️ Color Palette
Light Palette
Name	Hex
Primary Light Blue	#2378FF
Soft Sand	#FADEBC
Soft Lavender	#CDABFF
Dusty Blue	#91A6EB
Dark Palette
Name	Hex
Deep Blue	#4389CC
Pure Black	#000000
Primary Blue	#2378FF

These palettes establish a flexible foundation for visual design, supporting both bright and muted compositions.
Colors may be used as:

Base colors (backgrounds, sections)

Accents (icons, highlights, diagrams, UI elements)

Contrasts to guide the user's eye and break monotony

🌈 Gradient System

- Primary gradient: blend #FADEBC → #CDABFF → #2378FF for elevated hero backgrounds
- Deep foundation: mix #0B1630 → #0B1B3A for immersive dark canvases
- Accent glows: apply blurred circles of #CDABFF and #2378FF behind content cards
- Contrast care: keep copy in pure white or #0B1B3A for WCAG-friendly ratios

🚀 Signature Hero Layout

- Two-column grid: left column for copy, right column for layered device mockups
- Copy stack:
  - Kicker pill with uppercase Montserrat, semi-transparent background
  - Hero headline in Merriweather with a gradient-highlighted line
  - Body text capped at 60 characters per line for readability
- CTA pair: primary gradient pill + ghost/outline secondary pill
- Data chips: three compact stat cards (label, value, delta) to echo the analytics story
- Visual stack: payment card panel + forthcoming phone/tablet renders framed inside soft shadows
- Background: combine the gradient system + glow orbs to recreate the Stripe-like energy

🖼️ Device Mock Guidelines

- Phone mock: tall, rounded rectangle (24px radius) with a floating pay form
- Tablet mock: 16:10 ratio, subtle glassmorphism, used for analytics views
- Maintain 24px padding minimum inside mockups to match the UI rhythm
- When assets are missing, use dashed placeholders with “Guidelines arriving soon” copy

✒️ Typography
Secondary Font

Montserrat

Sans-serif

Clean, modern, corporate
Ideal for: body text, long-form content, articles, and emphasis sections


Primary Font

Merriweather

Serif

Strong, elegant, high-legibility
Ideal for: hero headlines, marquee statistics, premium editorial callouts



📘 Usage Guidelines

Use Montserrat for most UI and branding materials.

Use Merriweather for hero headlines, spotlight numerics, and premium subheads.

Light and dark palettes can be mixed depending on layout needs.

Blues (#2378FF and #4389CC) serve as primary brand anchors.

Accent colors (#FADEBC, #CDABFF, #91A6EB) should be used to add depth, contrast, or visual interest.

Avoid overly saturated applications; keep compositions clean, modern, and balanced.
