PrimEx will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures throughout the term of the Agreement to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of Customer Data.

PrimEx will notify the Customer of such updates and modifications in advance via email, the support portal, the release notes, the documentation, or the Service.

If the customer determines that an update or modification does not merely represent an improvement and leads to a significant devaluation of the contractually agreed service, he must inform PrimEx of this.

If there is a significant restriction of the service due to an update or modification which PrimEx cannot remove within a reasonable period of time, the customer is entitled to terminate the affected service without notice within thirty days of the expiry of this period by giving PrimEx written notice.

Rights of use and restrictions
7.1 Right of use

Subject to the Service Agreement and other contractual provisions, the Customer is granted a simple, non-exclusive, non-transferable right, limited to the term of the contractual relationship, to access the Services via a browser and an internet connection and to use them for its own business purposes or the business purposes of the Customer’s affiliated companies. Use for third-party business purposes is only permitted if and to the extent expressly provided for in the Service Agreement. In any case, the right of use is granted only to the extent specified in the Service Agreement.

7.2 Authorized Users

The Customer designates Authorized Users and permits them to use the Service. Usage is limited to the usage metrics and volumes specified in the Service Agreement. The access credentials for the Service refer to one Authorized User each and may not be used by more than one person.

The Customer is responsible for any breaches of the Agreement caused by Authorized Users.

7.3 Interruption of Service

PrimEx may suspend or restrict use of the Service if continued use could cause significant damage to the Service, its users, or PrimEx and its affiliates.

Regarding downtime, reference is made to the availability provisions in the SLA.

7.4 Third-party web services

The Service may include integrations with web services or services provided by third parties, or third-party web services or services may be used to access the PrimEx mobil Service.

Access to web services and services recognizable to the customer (e.g., Android or Apple App Store), as well as their availability and use, is subject to the terms and conditions of the third parties that provide them. Web services and services from third-party providers are not part of the contractual agreement between PrimEx and the customer, so these Terms and Conditions do not apply to them.

Data protection
16.1 Roles

The customer data processed in the provision of the contractual services may contain personal data. PrimEx processes this personal data – unless expressly stated otherwise – on behalf of and in accordance with the instructions of the customer. In these cases, PrimEx is the processor within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR, while the customer remains the controller within the meaning of Art. 24 GDPR.

16.2 Personal data

Both parties undertake to comply with applicable data protection laws, in particular the General Data Protection Regulation and the Federal Data Protection Act, when processing personal data within the scope of their cooperation.

The Customer shall ensure that all personal data contained in the Customer Data is collected and maintained in accordance with these data protection laws.

16.3 Reference to AVV

If PrimEx processes personal data on behalf of the customer, the parties conclude a data processing agreement pursuant to Art. 28 (3) GDPR (“DPA”). The DPA is an annex to the service agreement and conclusively governs the data processing relationship between the parties.

PrimEx will only provide Professional Services if expressly agreed between the parties. Unless otherwise agreed, the following applies:

a) PrimEx will invoice the Client monthly for the actual expenditures incurred for the Professional Services. These expenditures include labor hours, materials, travel costs, expenses, and other costs necessary to provide the agreed services.
b) PrimEx reserves the right to set hourly rates within the usual industry framework and to use them as a basis for calculating the costs. The agreed hourly rates will be communicated to the customer before the commencement of the respective services to be invoiced.
Embargo, export restrictions
The parties mutually undertake to comply with all export control, embargo and sanction laws and regulations applicable under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany and/or the laws of the European Union (EU) that restrict, prohibit or subject to licensing the import, export, re-export or transfer of goods, software, technology and data and the provision of services, directly or indirectly, to certain countries, for certain end uses or to certain end users; this also applies with regard to applicable US and other national law, insofar as German or European law does not conflict with this (“Applicable Foreign Trade Law”).

In the event that restrictions exist on the sale, delivery, transfer, provision and/or export of the Cloud Service or related services due to an embargo by the EU, Germany or the United States, the legally binding conclusion of this Agreement is subject to the condition precedent of prior approval by the competent authority or authorities.

The Customer confirms, represents and warrants that the Customer is not subject to any sanctions, including, without limitation, that the Customer is not listed on any list of persons, organizations or entities (“POEs”) with whom business is restricted or prohibited. The Customer further confirms, represents and warrants that the Customer is not, directly or indirectly, majority-owned or controlled by any such POE and/or

POE. Lists of POE include, among others, those issued by the EU or one of its Member States, the United Nations Security Council (UN), and/or the US government. These confirmations only extend to sanctions lists relating to economic sanctions measures taken by one or more states against another state and issued by an entity other than the UN, the EU, or the Federal Republic of Germany, if the UN, the EU, or the Federal Republic of Germany have also taken – albeit not identical – economic sanctions measures against that state (“Applicable Sanctions List”). The Customer will inform PrimEx immediately if the Customer itself or one of the POEs that hold or control the Customer is listed on an Applicable Sanctions List. Notwithstanding the foregoing confirmations, representations and warranties, the Customer agrees to promptly provide, upon request, all information and documentation that will enable PrimEx to conduct a comprehensive sanctions list screening of the Customer, including information about the shareholders, beneficial owners and management of the Customer.

The Customer may not, directly or indirectly, resell, deliver, transfer, or otherwise make available the Cloud Service or services received from PrimEx to a POE that is subject to sanctions under applicable foreign trade law, or is directly or indirectly majority-owned or controlled by a POE that is subject to sanctions under applicable foreign trade law. If the Cloud Service is included in lists of goods or technology whose sale, delivery, transfer, provision, or export to a specific country or region is prohibited or subject to authorization under applicable foreign trade law (“embargoed country or region”), the Customer may not, directly or indirectly, (re-)sell, (re-)export, or otherwise deliver, transfer, or make available the acquired software to a POE in the embargoed country or region, or for use in the embargoed country or region, unless a (general) authorization from the competent authority has been obtained. This applies in particular, but not exclusively, to the provision of the software to POEs based in Russia, including subsidiaries or other group companies based in Russia that are owned or under the sole or joint control of a POE established or registered under the laws of an EU Member State, a country belonging to the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, or a partner country listed in Annex VIII to Regulation (EU) 833/2014, and the use of General Authorization No. 42 from the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control (BAFA). The customer must provide PrimEx with evidence of effective use of General Authorization No. 42 before providing the software to PEB in Russia, without the need for a request or demand from PrimEx.

All previous assurances, discussions, and documents are incorporated into and superseded by the contract. Any confidentiality agreements concluded remain in effect, however. The contract may only be amended by mutual consent and in writing, unless expressly agreed otherwise. The customer’s general terms and conditions do not apply. This also applies if the customer refers to its own terms and conditions, e.g., in the context of orders or purchase orders, and PrimEx does not expressly object to these or otherwise accepts the order.

19.2 Severability clause

Should any provision of this Agreement be found to be invalid, ineffective, or unenforceable, the validity, effectiveness, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain unaffected. The parties undertake to replace the invalid, ineffective, or unenforceable provision with a legally permissible provision that most closely approximates the purpose of the original provision.

19.3 Formal requirements

Signatures in any common electronic form (including email or dedicated signature solutions) are considered original signatures.

PrimEx reserves the right to change or update these Terms and Conditions at any time if necessary for legal, technical, or operational reasons. Changes to these Terms and Conditions will be communicated to the customer at least 60 days prior to their effective date.

The amended Terms and Conditions become part of the contract if the customer agrees to the changes. If the customer does not agree to the changes within a period specified by PrimEx, which is at least 30 days, the contract remains unchanged. In this case, PrimEx is entitled to terminate the contract with immediate effect with 60 days’ notice if the contractual provision of services without the changes to the Terms and Conditions is impossible or unreasonable for technical or legal reasons.

PrimEx is obliged to inform the customer of the possibility of extraordinary termination in the notification.

19.5 Regulatory Matters

19.7 Subcontracting

PrimEx may subcontract the contractually agreed services, or parts thereof, to third parties, provided the quality of the service provision is not compromised. PrimEx remains liable to the customer for any breaches of contract caused by its subcontractors.

19.8 Compliance with laws

Each Party shall ensure current and ongoing compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to:

a) In the case of PrimEx, the operation of PrimEx’s business as it relates to the Service, and
b) in the case of the customer, the customer data and the customer’s use of the service. This contract exists independently of the legal provisions applicable to the customer or PrimEx.
19.9 Relationship between the parties

The parties act as independent contractors. This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, or employment relationship between the parties.

Der Kunde ist für die Kundendaten sowie deren Eingabe in den Service selbst verantwortlich. Eine Eingabe von Kundendaten in den Cloud-Service durch PrimEx im Kundenauftrag erfolgt nur, soweit dies gesondert im  Leistungsvereinbarung  geregelt ist. Der Kunde gewährt PrimEx sowie seinen Verbundenen Unternehmen und seinen Unterauftragnehmern ein nicht ausschließliches Recht zur Verwendung und Verarbeitung von Kundendaten in dem zur Bereitstellung des Services sowie zu den sonst in diesen AGB genannten Zwecken erforderlichen Umfang. Weitere Nutzungsrechte werden nur gewährt, sofern vertraglich vereinbart. Der Kunde bleibt verantwortlicher Eigentümer der Kundendaten.

5.4 Sicherheit

Der Kunde ist verpflichtet, technische und organisatorische Maßnahmen zu ergreifen und während der Vertragsdauer aufrechtzuerhalten, um einen unberechtigten Zugriff auf den bereitgestellten Service zu verhindern. Hierzu wird der Kunde insbesondere angemessene Sicherheitsstandards für die Nutzung des Services durch seine Autorisierten Nutzer einhalten und die Zugangsdaten streng vertraulich behandeln.

Der Kunde muss seine Nutzung des Services fortlaufend überwachen und jede Nutzung, die die Nutzungsmetriken und das vertraglich vereinbarte Volumen überschreitet, unverzüglich PrimEx melden. 

PrimEx ist berechtigt, die Nutzungsmetriken des bereitgestellten Services insoweit zu überwachen, als dies für die Sicherstellung der Einhaltung des im  Leistungsvereinbarung  vereinbarten Nutzungsumfangs erforderlich ist.

Der Kunde verpflichtet sich, Maßnahmen zu unterlassen, die die Überwachung der Nutzungsmetriken behindern oder verhindern könnten. Dazu gehört insbesondere das Umgehen von Sicherheitsmechanismen oder das Manipulieren von Daten, die für die Erfassung der Nutzungsmetriken relevant sind. Verstöße gegen diese Verpflichtung berechtigen PrimEx zur außerordentlichen Kündigung aus wichtigem Grund.

6. Rechte und Pflichten von PrimEx

6.1 Bereitstellung und Support

PrimEx gewährt Autorisierten Nutzern des Kunden im vertraglichen Umfang Zugang zum bereitgestellten Service und leistet Support in dem im  Leistungsvereinbarung  vereinbarten Umfang.

PrimEx wird den Kunden über solche Updates und Modifikationen im Vorhinein per E-Mail, über das Support-Portal, die Versionshinweise, die Dokumentation oder den Service informieren. 

Stellt der Kunde fest, dass ein Update oder eine Modifikation nicht nur eine Verbesserung darstellt und zu einer nicht nur unerheblichen Herabwertung der vertraglich vereinbarten Leistung führt, hat er PrimEx hierüber in Kenntnis zu setzen.

Liegt eine erhebliche Einschränkung des Services durch ein Update oder eine Modifikation vor, welche PrimEx nicht innerhalb einer angemessenen Frist aufheben kann, ist der Kunde berechtigt den betroffenen Service innerhalb von dreißig Tagen nach Ablauf dieser Frist durch schriftliche Mitteilung gegenüber PrimEx fristlos zu kündigen. 

7. Nutzungsrechte und Beschränkungen

7.1 Nutzungsrecht

Der Kunde erhält nach Maßgabe des  Leistungsvereinbarung s sowie der sonstigen vertraglichen Bestimmungen ein einfaches, nicht ausschließliches, nicht übertragbares, auf die Dauer des Vertragsverhältnisses begrenztes Recht, auf die Services mittels eines Browsers und einer Internetverbindung zuzugreifen und für eigene Geschäftszwecke oder die Geschäftszwecke von Verbundenen Unternehmen des Kunden zu nutzen.

PrimEx kann die Nutzung des Services aussetzen oder einschränken, sofern die fortgesetzte Nutzung dem Service, seinen Nutzern oder PrimEx und seinen Verbundenen Unternehmen erheblichen Schaden zufügen könnte.

Für die Zahlung der Gebühren gelten die folgenden Bedingungen (Ziff. 9.2 (Laufende Gebühren) bis 9.6 (Anpassungen durch den Kunden)), sofern die Parteien keine abweichenden Bedingungen im  Leistungsvereinbarung  getroffen haben.

Die erste Zahlung für die im Leistungsvereinbarung  aufgeführten Leistungen ist zum Abonnementstart nach Rechnungsstellung fällig und ist vom Abschluss etwaiger Onboarding-Services oder weiteren vereinbarten Leistungen unabhängig.

9.5 Aussetzung der Leistung bei ausbleibender Zahlung

Hat der Kunde fällige Gebühren in Höhe von mindestens 5.000,- € netto oder 10 % der Jahresabonnementgebühren (der niedrigere Betrag ist maßgeblich) trotz Rechnungstellung nicht innerhalb der Zahlungsfrist gezahlt und erfolgt die Zahlung auch nach Mahnung durch PrimEx mit angemessener Fristsetzung und ausdrücklicher Ankündigung einer möglichen Aussetzung der Leistung nicht, so ist PrimEx berechtigt, den Zugriff des Kunden auf die Services bis zur vollständigen Zahlung der fälligen Gebühren sowie der angefallenen Verzugszinsen einzuschränken oder auszusetzen. Der Zugriff wird bei Eingang der vollständigen Zahlung unverzüglich wieder freigegeben.

 

 

9.6 Anpassungen durch den Kunden

Der Kunde kann während der Abonnementlaufzeit geschuldete Gebühren weder zurückhalten, noch reduzieren noch aufrechnen, es sei denn es liegt eine schwere Pflichtverletzung durch PrimEx vor.

Die Parteien verpflichten sich gegenseitig zur Einhaltung aller nach dem Recht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland und/oder dem Recht der Europäischen Union (EU) anwendbaren Exportkontroll-, Embargo- und Sanktionsgesetze und -vorschriften, die den Import, Export, Reexport oder den Transfer von Gütern, Software, Technologie und Daten und die Erbringung von Dienstleistungen, unmittelbar oder mittelbar, in bestimmte Länder, für bestimmte Endverwendungen oder an bestimmte Endverwender beschränken, verbieten oder einer Genehmigungspflicht unterwerfen; dies gilt auch im Hinblick auf anwendbares US-amerikanisches und sonstiges nationales Recht, soweit deutsche oder europäische Rechtsvorschriften dem nicht entgegenstehen („Anwendbares Außenwirtschaftsrecht“).

Für den Fall, dass für den Verkauf, die Lieferung, die Verbringung, die Bereitstellung und/oder die Ausfuhr des Cloud Service oder damit zusammenhängenden Dienstleistungen Beschränkungen aufgrund eines Embargos der EU, Deutschlands oder der Vereinigten Staaten bestehen, steht der rechtsverbindliche Abschluss dieses Vertrags unter der aufschiebenden Bedingung einer vorherigen Genehmigung durch die zuständige Behörde oder die zuständigen Behörden.

Der Kunde bestätigt, sichert zu und gewährleistet, dass der Kunde keinen Sanktionen unterliegt, insbesondere, dass der Kunde nicht in einer Liste von Personen, Organisationen oder Einrichtungen („POE“) aufgeführt ist, mit denen Geschäfte eingeschränkt oder verboten sind. Der Kunde bestätigt, sichert zu und gewährleistet darüber hinaus, dass der Kunde weder direkt noch indirekt im Mehrheitseigentum oder im Besitz einer solchen POE und/oder unter der Kontrolle einer solchen

POE steht. Listen von POE umfassen unter anderem die von der EU oder einem ihrer Mitgliedstaaten, dem Sicherheitsrat der Vereinten Nationen (UNO) und/oder der US-Regierung herausgegebenen Listen, wobei sich diese Bestätigungen nur dann auf Sanktionslisten erstrecken, die sich auf Wirtschaftssanktionsmaßnahmen beziehen, die von einem oder mehreren Staaten gegen einen anderen Staat ergriffen wurden und von einer anderen Stelle als der UNO, der EU oder der Bundesrepublik Deutschland herausgegeben wurden, wenn die UNO, die EU oder die Bundesrepublik Deutschland ebenfalls – wenn auch nicht identische – Wirtschaftssanktionsmaßnahmen gegen diesen Staat ergriffen haben („Anwendbare Sanktionsliste“). Der Kunde wird PrimEx unverzüglich informieren, wenn der Kunde selbst oder eine der POE, die den Kunden halten oder kontrollieren, in einer Anwendbaren Sanktionsliste aufgeführt ist. Ungeachtet der vorstehenden Bestätigungen, Zusicherungen und Gewährleistungen erklärt sich der Kunde bereit, auf Anfrage unverzüglich sämtliche Informationen und Unterlagen zur Verfügung zu stellen, die es PrimEx ermöglichen, ein umfassendes Sanktionslisten-Screening vom Kunden durchzuführen, einschließlich Informationen über die Gesellschafter, die wirtschaftlichen Endbegünstigten und den Vorstand des Kunden.

Der Kunde darf den Cloud Service oder Dienstleistungen, die er von PrimEx erhalten hat, weder direkt noch indirekt an eine POE weiterverkaufen, liefern, übertragen oder anderweitig zur Verfügung stellen, die Sanktionen nach dem Anwendbaren Außenwirtschaftsrecht unterliegt oder direkt oder indirekt im Mehrheitseigentum oder Besitz einer POE steht, die Sanktionen nach dem Anwendbaren Außenwirtschaftsrecht unterliegt, oder von dieser kontrolliert wird. Falls der Cloud Service in Listen von Gütern oder Technologie aufgeführt ist, deren Verkauf, Lieferung, Weitergabe, Bereitstellung oder Ausfuhr in ein bestimmtes Land oder eine bestimmte Region nach Anwendbarem Außenwirtschaftsrecht verboten oder genehmigungspflichtig ist („Embargoland oder -region“), darf der Kunde die bezogene Software weder direkt noch indirekt an eine POE in dem Embargoland oder der Embargoregion oder zur Verwendung in dem Embargoland oder der Embargoregion (weiter-)verkaufen, (re-)exportieren oder anderweitig liefern, weitergeben oder bereitstellen, es sei denn, es liegt eine (Allgemeine) Genehmigung der zuständigen Behörde vor. Dies gilt insbesondere, aber nicht ausschließlich, für die Bereitstellung der Software an POE mit Sitz in Russland, darunter Tochtergesellschaften oder anderweitige Konzerngesellschaften mit Sitz in Russland, welche sich im Eigentum oder unter der alleinigen oder gemeinsamen Kontrolle einer nach dem Recht eines EU-Mitgliedstaats, eines dem Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum (EWR) angehörenden Landes, der Schweiz oder eines in Anhang VIII der Verordnung (EU) 833/2014 aufgeführten Partnerlandes gegründeten oder eingetragenen POE befinden, und der Inanspruchnahme der Allgemeinen Genehmigung Nr. 42 des Bundesamts für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle (BAFA). Der Kunde muss PrimEx die wirksame Inanspruchnahme der Allgemeinen Genehmigung Nr. 42 vor Bereitstellung der Software an PEB in Russland nachweisen, ohne dass es hierfür einer Anfrage oder Aufforderung durch PrimEx bedarf.

19. Schlussbestimmungen

19.1 Gesamte Vereinbarung

Das  Leistungsvereinbarung  sowie die dort als Vertragsbestandteil aufgeführten Anlagen – inklusive dieser AGB – stellen die vollständige und ausschließliche Vereinbarung zwischen PrimEx und dem Kunden im Zusammenhang mit der Geschäftsbeziehung der Parteien in Bezug auf den Vertragsgegenstand dar. Alle früheren Zusicherungen, Besprechungen und Schriftstücke sind im Vertrag aufgegangen und werden durch diesen ersetzt. Etwaig geschlossene Vertraulichkeitsabreden gelten jedoch fort. Der Vertrag kann nur im beidseitigen Einverständnis und in schriftlicher Form geändert werden, sofern nicht ausdrücklich anders vereinbart. Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingungen des Kunden finden keine Anwendung. Dies gilt auch dann, wenn der Kunde z.B. im Rahmen von Bestellungen oder Purchase Orders auf eigene Geschäftsbedingungen verweist und PrimEx diesen nicht ausdrücklich widerspricht oder sonst die Bestellung annimmt.

19.2 Salvatorische Klausel

Falls sich eine Bestimmung des Vertrags als ungültig, unwirksam oder nicht durchsetzbar erweist, bleiben die Gültigkeit, Wirksamkeit und Durchsetzbarkeit der restlichen Bestimmungen des Vertrags davon unberührt. Die Parteien verpflichten sich, anstelle der ungültigen, unwirksamen oder nicht durchsetzbaren Regelung eine solche gesetzlich zulässige Regelung zu treffen, die dem Zweck der ursprünglichen Regelung am nächsten kommt.

19.3 Formerfordernisse

Unterschriften in jeder gängigen elektronischen Form (einschließlich E-Mail oder dedizierte Signaturlösungen) gelten als Originalunterschriften.

Alle Mitteilungen müssen – sofern nicht ausdrücklich abweichend vereinbart – in elektronischer Form erfolgen und an die im  Leistungsvereinbarung  angegebene Adresse zugestellt werden. Mitteilungen von PrimEx, die sich auf Betrieb, Modifikation, Update oder Support des Services beziehen, können in Form einer elektronischen Mitteilung an den im  Leistungsvereinbarung  angegebenen bevollmächtigten Vertreter oder Administrator des Kunden erfolgen. 

19.4 Änderungen der AGB

PrimEx behält sich das Recht vor, diese AGB jederzeit zu ändern oder zu aktualisieren, sofern dies aus rechtlichen, technischen oder betrieblichen Gründen erforderlich ist. Änderungen dieser AGB werden dem Kunden mindestens 60 Tage vor ihrem Inkrafttreten mitgeteilt.

Die geänderten AGB werden Vertragsbestandteil, sofern der Kunde den Änderungen zustimmt. Stimmt der Kunde den Änderungen innerhalb einer von PrimEx genannten Frist, die mindestens 30 Tage beträgt, nicht zu, bleibt der Vertrag unverändert bestehen. In diesem Fall ist PrimEx berechtigt, den Vertrag mit einer Frist von 60 Tagen außerordentlich zu kündigen, sofern eine vertragsgemäße Leistungserbringung ohne die Änderungen der AGB aus technischen oder rechtlichen Gründen unmöglich oder unzumutbar ist.

PrimEx ist verpflichtet, den Kunden in der Mitteilung auf die Möglichkeit der außerordentlichen Kündigung hinzuweisen.

 

19.5 Regulatorische Angelegenheiten

Die Vertraulichen Informationen von PrimEx unterliegen den Exportkontrollgesetzen verschiedener Länder, einschließlich der Gesetze der Vereinigten Staaten und Deutschlands. Der Kunde darf die Vertraulichen Informationen von PrimEx keiner Regierungsbehörde zur Prüfung von Lizenzen oder anderen behördlichen Genehmigungen vorlegen und darf die Vertraulichen Informationen von PrimEx nicht in Länder oder an Personen oder Unternehmen exportieren, wenn dies durch Exportgesetze verboten ist.

 

19.6 Abtretung

Ohne die vorherige schriftliche Zustimmung von PrimEx ist der Kunde nicht berechtigt, den Vertrag (oder seine Rechte und Pflichten aus dem Vertrag) an eine andere Partei abzutreten oder zu übertragen. PrimEx ist berechtigt, den Vertrag an eines seiner Verbundenen Unternehmen abzutreten. 

19.7 Unterauftragsvergabe

PrimEx kann die vertraglich vereinbarten Leistungen oder Teile hiervon an Dritte unterbeauftragen, sofern die Qualität der Leistungserbringung dadurch nicht beeinträchtigt wird. PrimEx bleibt für Vertragsverletzungen, die durch seine Unterauftragnehmer verursacht werden, dem Kunden gegenüber verantwortlich.

19.8 Einhaltung von Gesetzen

Jede Partei gewährleistet die aktuelle und fortwährende Einhaltung aller für sie geltenden Gesetze und Vorschriften im Zusammenhang mit: 

a) Im Fall von PrimEx, dem Betrieb des Geschäfts von PrimEx, soweit es sich auf den Service bezieht, und 

b) im Fall des Kunden, den Kundendaten und der Nutzung des Services durch den Kunden.  Der Vertrag besteht unabhängig von den auf den Kunden oder PrimEx anwendbaren gesetzlichen Bestimmungen.

19.9 Verhältnis der Parteien zueinander

Die Parteien agieren als voneinander unabhängige Vertragspartner. Durch den Vertrag wird kein Partnerschafts-, Franchise-, Joint-Venture-, Agentur-, Treuhand- oder Arbeitsverhältnis zwischen den Parteien begründet. 

19.10 Geltendes Recht und Gerichtsstand
